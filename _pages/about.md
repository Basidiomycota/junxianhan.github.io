I am a PhD student at Kyoto University. I have a wide range of interests，including music, idol, football, e-sports and literature. I played the clarinet in the college symphony orchestra. I am the fan of [Bayer04 Leverkusen](https://www.bayer04.de/de-de) in the Bundesliga. My favourite idol is [Konoka Matsuda](https://www.hinatazaka46.com/s/official/diary/member/list?ima=0000&ct=18) of [Hinatakaza46](https://www.hinatazaka46.com/s/official/?ima=0000).
